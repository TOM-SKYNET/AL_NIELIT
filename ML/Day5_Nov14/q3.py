	3) Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you
	want to determine applicantsâ€™ chance to get admitted to a course.
	Admission is based on the scores of two exams. You have the historical data
	of earlier students. The data contains the marks of two exams and their
	admission status. Data is available in the file ex3.txt.
		a)Visualize the data using scatterplot (score1 in X axis , score2 in Y axis and
		two different colours for admitted and non admitted students)
		b)Develop an ML model to predict the admission status of a new set of students.
